# Infrared passenger flow series product communication protocol

## 1. Brief description of the protocol

- The protocol is currently only for infrared people counter Digital version series products. Other products will support this protocol in the future. Please pay attention to this in time for subsequent update records.
- When designing this protocol, low power consumption, low computing power and other devices were also taken into consideration, so the protocol is directly based on TCP and uses hexadecimal + ANSII code for transmission.
- The protocol takes into account special situations such as sticky packets and escaping.
- Applicable model: HX-HE2(WD5)
## 2. Detailed explanation of the protocol

### 2.1 Protocol structure

The protocol consists of 8 parts, fixed header, fixed trailer, device ID, instructions, parameters, data length, data, CRC, frame trailer

The fixed header and fixed trailer are both fixed. The device ID is currently a reserved bit. The default is a 32-bit integer currently fixed at 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF. The CRC uses ModbusCRC16, and the data part uses commas for field separation. In order to prevent fixed header and fixed trailer data from appearing in the data part and CRC part, the escape bit: 0x7C is introduced.

| Fixed frame header | Fixed device ID | Command | Parameter | Data length |      Data       | ModbusCRC16 low eight bits | ModbusCRC16 high eight bits | Fixed frame tail |
| :----------------: | :-------------: | :-----: | :-------: | :---------: | :-------------: | :------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :--------------: |
|       1 byte       |   four bytes    | 1 byte  |  1 byte   | double byte | variable length |           1 byte           |           1 byte            |      1 byte      |

- Fixed frame header: 0x7E
- Fixed device ID: 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF 0xFF
- Command: See the command description chapter for details
- Parameters: See the instruction description chapter for details
- Data length: The length of the data part is int16 type, transmitted in double words.
- Data: ANSII string
- ModbusCRC16 lower eight bits: ModbusCRC16 lower eight bits
- ModbusCRC16 high eight bits: ModbusCRC16 high eight bits
- Fixed frame end: 0x7D
- Escape character: 0x7C

#### 2.1.1 Fixed header and trailer

The header is 7E and ends at 7D.

7E ............ 7D Such data is a complete packet of data

#### 2.1.2 Instructions and parameters

Instructions and parameters are used to distinguish different data types, including **heartbeat data**, **data reporting**, and **historical data reporting**

#### 2.1.3 Data length and data

The data length is used to calculate the length of the data part and to facilitate developers to intercept the data part through the data length. The data in the data part is composed of **field bits** and **comma delimiters**. It will be explained in detail in the field definition chapter.

Example:

Client initiated data: 1902201010001,20220101090004,10,20,1,V4.3,E20 Note: The length is 45

Actual data initiated by the client: 00 2D 31 39 30 32 32 30 31 30 31 30 30 30 31 2C 32 30 32 32 30 31 30 31 30 39 30 30 30 34 2C 31 30 2C 32 30 2C 31 2C 56 34 2E 33 2C 45 32 30

Note: The first two bytes are the data length: 0x00 0x2D. The high position is in front and the low position is in the back. What follows is the ASCII code corresponding to the string

#### 2.1.4 ModbusCRC16 checksum

The ModbusCRC16 check range does not include fixed frame headers and fixed frame tails. The calculation range is: fixed device ID, instructions, parameters, data length, and data. These locations must participate in ModbusCRC16 calculations. The purpose of ModbusCRC16 checksum calculation is to ensure the accuracy of data. The C language implementation code is as follows:

```c
#include "h_crc.h"

ushort const TAB_CRC16_ITU[256] =
    {
        0x0000, 0xC0C1, 0xC181, 0x0140, 0xC301, 0x03C0, 0x0280, 0xC241,

Bool Is_CRC16_Good(uchar *pData, uint nLength)
{
    ushort Fcs = 0xFFFF;

    while (nLength > 0)
    {
        Fcs = (Fcs >> 8) ^ TAB_CRC16_ITU[(Fcs ^ *pData) & 0xFF];
        nLength--;
        pData++;
    }

    if (Fcs == 0)
        return True;
    else
        return False;
}

ushort CRC16_ITU_Generate(uchar *pData, int nLength)
{
    ushort Fcs;

    Fcs = 0xFFFF;
    while (nLength > 0)
    {
        Fcs = (Fcs >> 8) ^ TAB_CRC16_ITU[(Fcs ^ *pData) & 0xFF];
        nLength--;
        pData++;
    }

    return Fcs;
}

```

When verifying data verification, you need to perform verification calculation again on the fixed device ID, command, parameter, data length, data and ModbusCRC16 two bytes. If the result is equal to 0, then the verification is successful, otherwise it fails.

#### 2.1.5 Escape

The purpose of the escape character is to prevent the sender from appearing in non-packet header and tail positions when sending a message, which makes it difficult for the receiving method to parse the data. The implementation method is as follows:

0x7D: Change to 0x7C 0x5D and send

0x7E: Change to 0x7C 0x5E and send

It is worth noting here what to do if 7C itself appears. same:

0x7C: Change to 0x7C 0x5C and send

The specific implementation code is as follows:

sender:

```c
case 0x7D: 
	rsbus_frame_data[rsbus_frame_data_index++] = 0x7C;
	rsbus_frame_data[rsbus_frame_data_index++] = rsbus_send.send_buf[i] - 0x20;
	break;
case 0x7E: 
	rsbus_frame_data[rsbus_frame_data_index++] = 0x7C;
	rsbus_frame_data[rsbus_frame_data_index++] = rsbus_send.send_buf[i] - 0x20;
	break;
case 0x7C: 
	rsbus_frame_data[rsbus_frame_data_index++] = 0x7C;
	rsbus_frame_data[rsbus_frame_data_index++] = rsbus_send.send_buf[i] - 0x20;
	break;
```

When escaping, the sender first sends 0x7C, and then subtracts 0x20.

receiver:

```c#
if (recv == 0x7C) 
{
	if (rec_head_flag == true) 
	{
		rec_specialData_flag = true; 
        return;
	}
}

if (rec_specialData_flag == true) 
{
    recbuf[recbuf_index++] = (byte)(recv ^ 0x20);
    rec_specialData_flag = false;

    return;
}
```

When the receiver receives 7C, it needs to perform restoration processing. The specific method is to perform the ^ 0x20 operation on the data after 0x7C to restore it.



### 2.2 Protocol instruction description

When transmitting data bits, they are sent in ANSII hexadecimal format. For the convenience of demonstration, strings are used here.

#### 2.2.1 Heartbeat command 0xD1

1. When the device is powered on, the time is synchronized and a heartbeat is automatically uploaded (the platform can display that the device is online at this time)

2. If the device fails to synchronize the time when it is powered on, a heartbeat will also be sent when the user manually binds the code for the device to synchronize the time.

3. The device uploads a heartbeat every half hour during business hours, which is used by the platform to determine the online and offline status. The device does not report heartbeats and data outside business hours
